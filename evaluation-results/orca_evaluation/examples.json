    "reference": "Title: Discovering the Languages Spoken: A Look at the Census\n\nHi, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about something called a \"census.\" A census is when people collect information about everyone living in a country. One of the things they ask is what language everyone speaks. Sometimes, people don't speak English even if they live in a country where most people do.\n\nNow, let's try to find out what percent of people in our imaginary country don't speak English. For this, we'll use pretend numbers, okay?\n\nImagine that there are 1,000 people living in this country. After the census, we learn that 800 of them speak English. But that means there are still 200 people who don't speak English. \n\nTo find the percent of people who don't speak English, we're going to play with numbers. Here's what we do: \n\nStep 1: We take the number of people who don't speak English (200) and divide it by the total number of people (1,000). Like this: \n\n200 \u00f7 1,000 = 0.2 \n\nStep 2: To change 0.2 into a percent, we simply multiply it by 100. Like this:\n\n0.2 x 100 = 20\n\nThat's it! We found out that 20% of the people in our imaginary country don't speak English. Isn't it interesting to learn about different languages and cultures? Just remember that every country and every census is different. The real numbers might be very different from our pretend ones.\n\nNow you know how to find what percentage of people don't speak a particular language using a census! Keep learning, little friends, and who knows what interesting things you'll discover next!",

    "system_prompt": "You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.",
    "reference": "Indeed, the correct choice is \"spread wings,\" as it best describes the process of how birds leave the nest for the first time. Bird nests serve as a shelter for the eggs and a safe space for the baby birds, also known as fledglings, to grow and develop. As fledglings mature, they eventually become capable of leaving the nest and living independently. This event is called fledging. Their journey out of the nest involves several stages, some of which include learning and practicing essential skills for survival.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the process:\n\n1. Nestling stage: After hatching, baby birds are referred to as nestlings. During this stage, they are usually blind, featherless, and rely entirely on their parents for food, warmth, and protection. They stay within the confines of the nest as they develop their muscles and grow feathers.\n\n2. Growing feathers: Over time, nestlings develop feathers, first as downy fluff and eventually as proper contour and flight feathers. Feathers are essential for insulation, protection, camouflage, and, most importantly, flight.\n\n3. Developing muscles: While still in the nest, nestlings start to exercise their muscles by stretching and flapping their wings. This helps them build the strength necessary for flight.\n\n4. Perching and hopping: As their muscles and feathers develop, fledglings start practicing perching on the edge of the nest or tree branches. They might also attempt short hops between close branches or within the nest to further improve their balance and coordination.\n\n5. Food begging and exploration: During this stage, fledglings begin to associate their parents' arrival with food. They may venture out of the nest to be closer to the parents and beg for food more effectively. This behavior also encourages them to become more confident in leaving the nest.\n\n6. Taking flight: Finally, after all the preparation and practice, a fledgling will spread its wings and take its first flight. The initial flights are often shaky and may involve a lot of falling or gliding, but fledglings gradually gain confidence and improve their flying capabilities. Parents continue to feed and supervise their young ones for a few days or weeks after they fledge, ensuring they learn essential skills such as finding food and avoiding predators.\n\nIn summary, leaving the nest is more than just a simple act of spreading wings. It is a complex and gradual process involving the development of feathers and muscles, practicing essential skills, gaining confidence, and the fledgling's first attempts at flight. Spreading wings is perhaps the most critical aspect of this process, as it ultimately allows fledglings to become independent, self-sufficient birds.",

They use different methods to migrate, whether it's through the air, on land, or in water. Some examples of these migration",

Amidst the challenges of establishing a new political framework and appeasing various stakeholders, the NTC now faces the daunting task of minimizing revenge killings within Libya. According to a Libyan dissident, the rebel government projects that it will take approximately 18 to 20 months to establish a functional and comprehensive political system.\n\nThe aftermath of Gadhafi's removal from power sent shockwaves throughout Libya. A power vacuum emerged, creating opportunities for various entities to assert their influence and stake their claims within this new political landscape. As the NTC strives to rebuild the nation, analysts suggest that several entities will wield considerable influence in the post-Gadhafi era, further complicating the road to stability.\n\nAmong the many challenges of maintaining a semblance of peace and order in this transitioning nation, the NTC is grappling with a significant number of revenge killings. As passions run high following the prolonged conflict and years of unrest, it is crucial for the NTC to address this potentially destabilizing element urgently. To maintain credibility on a global stage and retain the trust of its citizens, the NTC must demonstrate its ability to stem the tide of violence and seek justice for those affected by the terror of Gadhafi's reign.\n\nAs a Libyan dissident reported, the NTC has a long road ahead in terms of establishing a political framework. This estimated 18 to 20-month timeline highlights the complexity of shaping a system that will appease various influential actors and create a democratic environment conducive to fair representation and sustainable growth. The council's chairman recently brushed off the rebels' executive board, indicating the internal challenges that could further impede the formation of a new government.\n\nIn efforts to establish a viable political framework, the NTC will need to find a delicate balance between the interests of various stakeholders. These include powerful militia groups who played a critical role during the uprising, tribal factions seeking representation in the new system, international actors with vested interests in Libya, and of course, the diverse population who long for stability, safety, and prosperity after years of conflict.\n\nWith an estimated 18 to 20 months of planning and execution in store, the political future of the nation remains uncertain; however, the NTC must take clear steps in addressing the issue of revenge killings. Law and order must be at the forefront of their priorities, and creating a judicial framework that holds perpetrators accountable while also fostering reconciliation amongst the warring factions is vital.\n\nUltimately, the successful establishment of a new political structure in post-Gadhafi Libya will depend on the NTC's ability to navigate a treacherous landscape of competing interests and violent repercussions. By actively working to minimize revenge killings and developing a legitimate political framework that promotes fairness and representation, the NTC can mark the beginning of a new era in Libya and foster a legitimate democracy that the nation's people so desperately deserve.",
